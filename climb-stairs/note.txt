climb staircases
- climb 14 steps with max leap of 2

- to simplify the problem:
	leap of 1, leap of 2, max leap of 2
	1, 2, 3, 5 steps for max leap of 2
	any pattern?
- algorithm   ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
- programming
- recursive, ending condition

- climb 100 steps (or 354 steps at Status of Liberty)
- dynamic programming

- how about max leap of 3

generalization:
how many ways to reach level N, given one can take max leap of k?

- review with N=6 case;

- print out the actual ways?

- action before or after recursion calls

- iterative vs recursive
